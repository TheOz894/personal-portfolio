      My opinion of the use of AI is very negative, as AI is being used as a replacement instead as a tool. AI, or more accurately LLM, was supposed to be a big step towards actual AI, instead it ended up as a problem as major corporations put it in everything, even in things that shouldn't have AI. Corporations have replaced their artists and developers with AI to streamline the process for short term gains, not caring that in the long term it’ll impact their finances in upkeep. Not only that, people have been using it to flood social media with AI slop content that buried and devalued actual content, making it difficult to tell the difference between what's real and fake. AI has been harmful as well, generating false and potentially harmful information, making fake news, generating false evidence, being used in scams, and many more. It’s not cheap to run AI either as it is very expensive to maintain the data centers with energy and water. I'm all in favor of building a nuclear power plant, but using it to power one datacenter for an AI that’ll never be used is excessive.

      In terms of actual ethical use of AI, banning the replacement of employees with AI is a good place to start. AI isn’t mature enough to replace employees and it isn’t cheap. It can cause a multitude of problems since most of them are just LLMs being presented as Artificial Intelligence. It's a chatbot that knows how to string words together that would make sense. I’m not saying that AI should be totally banned but instead be used as a tool to aid employees when they need it. Another ethical use of AI is research, as AI has a great potential to aid scientists in research, especially in fields like quantum technology and astronomy. It may help to use AI to research on making AI cheaper and more environmentally friendly.

      In conclusion, AI is here to stay and depending on what we choose as a society, AI can either make the quality of life better or worse. So far AI has been used to decrease the quality of life as corporations see AI as an employee that can work forever and malicious actors use it to spread dangerous and false information. Yet it could accelerate research and find solutions to problems once it has matured enough. It could be that way, who knows what will happen next year, or the year after, or 5 years later. Guess we’ll see.
